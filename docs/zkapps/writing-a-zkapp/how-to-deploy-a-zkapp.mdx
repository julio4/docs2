zkApp programmability is not yet available on the Mina **Mainnet**, but zkApps can now be deployed on the Mina **Devnet**.

# How to Deploy a zkApp

Before deploying, you must first define a few settings, such as which network you are deploying your zkApp to. 

## Add a deploy alias to config.json

First, change into the directory that contains your smart contract and then run the following command:

```sh
$ zk config
```

When prompted, specify:

- The name (can be anything)
- The target network kind (`Testnet`, `Mainnet` or enter the custom network kind id) to deploy your zkApp to
- The URL to send the deploy transaction to
- Transaction fee (in MINA) to use when deploying
- The fee payer account to pay transaction fees from

For more details, see [deploy alias](/zkapps/tutorials/deploying-to-a-network#deploy-alias) section in corresponding tutorial. 

:::tip
If your project contains multiple smart contracts (for example, `Foo` and `Bar`) that
you intend to deploy to the same network, the best practice is to follow the naming convention such as `devnet-foo` and `devnet-bar` when naming your deploy aliases. You can change these alias names at any time by manually editing the `config.json` file.
:::

You see the following output:

```sh
$ zk config

Add a new network:
✔ Create a name (can be anything): · devnet
✔ Choose the target network: · Testnet
✔ Set the Mina GraphQL API URL to deploy to: · https://api.minascan.io/node/devnet/v1/graphql
✔ Set transaction fee to use when deploying (in MINA): · 0.1
✔ Choose an account to pay transaction fees: · Use stored account MyFeePayer (public key: B62...)
✔ Use stored fee payer MyFeePayer (public key: B62...)
✔ Create zkApp key pair at keys/devnet.json
✔ Add deploy alias to config.json

Success!

Next steps:

- If this is the testnet, request tMINA at:
  https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/?address=<FEE-PAYER-ACCOUNT>
- To deploy zkApp, run: `zk deploy devnet`
```

## Request funds from the Faucet

To deploy your zkApp, your fee payer account must have funds to pay for transaction fees.

To get funds on the Devnet, use the URL that was shown in the zkApp CLI output:
- Visit `https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/?address=<FEE-PAYER-ACCOUNT>`
- Choose the corresponding network you're going to deploy your zkApp to (`Devnet` in this case)
- And click the **Request** button

Before proceeding to the next step, wait a few minutes for the next block to include your transaction, so that tMINA becomes available for the fee payer account.

## Deploy your smart contract

To deploy your smart contract to the network, run the following command:

```sh
$ zk deploy devnet
```

Among other activities, when running the deploy command, zkApp CLI computes the verification key for your zkApp. Computing verification key can take 10-30 seconds, so please be patient. The zkApp CLI shows the details of the process, such as the network name, the URL, and the smart contract to deploy.

Finally, enter `yes` or `y` when prompted to confirm and send the deploy transaction.

You see the following output:

```sh
$ zk deploy devnet
✔ Build project
✔ Generate build.json
✔ Choose smart contract
  Only one smart contract exists in the project: Add
  Your config.json was updated to always use this
  smart contract when deploying to this network.
✔ Generate verification key (takes 10-30 sec)
✔ Build transaction
✔ Confirm to send transaction

  Are you sure you want to send (yes/no)? · y
✔ Send to network

Success! Deploy transaction sent.

Next step:
  Your smart contract will be live (or updated)
  at B62...
  as soon as the transaction is included in a block:
  https://minascan.io/devnet/tx/<txn-hash>?type=zk-tx
```

After a few minutes, the transaction is included in the next block.  
To see the zkApp transaction and navigate to accounts involved you can follow the transaction link provided to you in zkApp CLI output.  
Or use the [Minascan](https://minascan.io) explorer to search for the account with deployed zkApp.
