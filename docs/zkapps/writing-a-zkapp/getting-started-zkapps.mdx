# zkApps Getting Started

You can start writing zkApps with just a few steps. The focus of this Getting Started Guide is a high-level workflow to build and deploy quickly.

## High-Level Workflow

1. [Install or update the zkApp CLI](#1-install-or-update-the-zkapp-cli)
1. [Create a project](#2-create-a-project)
1. [Add testing code](#3-add-testing-code)
1. [Add functionality](#4-add-functionality)
1. [Create an integration test](#5-create-an-integration-test)
1. [Test locally](#6-test-with-local-simulated-blockchain)
1. [Test with Lightnet](#7-test-with-lightnet)
1. [Test with a live network](#8-test-with-a-live-network)

### 1. Install or update the zkApp CLI

```sh
npm install -g zkapp-cli
```

The zkApp CLI provides project scaffolding, including dependencies such as [o1js](/zkapps/writing-a-circuit), a test framework, code auto-formatting, linting, and more.

See [zkApp CLI Installation](/zkapps/install-zkapp-cli).

### 2. Create a project

```sh
$ zk project <project-name>
```

[o1js](/zkapps/writing-a-circuit) is automatically installed when you generate a project using the zkApp CLI. 

A zkApp consists of a smart contract and a UI to interact with it. 

- To proceed without an accompanying UI project, select `none` when prompted.

    See [Option B: Start your own project](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/how-to-write-a-zkapp#option-b-start-your-own-project).

- To create a UI, select a framework and follow the prompts. 

    See [How to Write a zkApp UI](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/how-to-write-a-zkapp-ui).

### 3. Add testing code

When you use the zkApp CLI to create a project, tests and examples are included. 

1. See the `import` statements in the [Add.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.test.ts#L1-L2) example file.

1. A simulated `LocalBlockchain` instance you can interact with is included in the [Add.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.test.ts#L27-L28) example file.

1. In o1js, an array of 10 test accounts to pay fees and sign transactions are provided for the simulated `LocalBlockchain` instance. These can be accessed with `Local.testAccounts` as shown in the [Add.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.test.ts#L29-L31) example file. The example uses the public/private key pairs of two of these accounts. The example uses these names, but the names can be anything:

    - `deployerAccount` deploys the smart contract
    - `senderAccount` pays transaction fees

1. Deploy the smart contract to the simulated `LocalBlockchain` instance that simulates a network for testing purposes.

    See the `localDeploy` function in the [Add.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.test.ts#L38-L46) example file.

### 4. Add functionality

Add the logic for your smart contract.

1. Start experimenting with iterative development to build and test one method at a time. Add functionality to the smart contract by implementing a `@method`.

    See `@method async update()` in the [Add.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.ts#L20-L24) example file.

1. Build the smart contract:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

1. Invoke the `@method` you added or use new functionality in the test file.

    See the transaction code that invokes the `update()` method in the [Add.test.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.test.ts#L57-L66) file.

    - If it works as expected with no errors, add more functionality.
    - If there are errors, look through the stack traces to find the source of the errors and update the contract to resolve them.

### 5. Create integration test

- Create a Node.js script to run the smart contract and test it's functionality, similar to step [3. Add testing code](#3-add-testing-code).

    For an example, see the Node.js script that runs the Tic Tac Toe smart contract in the [run.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/examples/tictactoe/ts/src/run.ts) file.

### 6. Test locally

- [Test zkApps locally](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/testing-zkapps-locally) with a simulated local blockchain.

### 7. Test with Lightnet

- Use [Lightnet](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/testing-zkapps-lightnet) to test your zkApp with an accurate representation of Mina blockchain. 

1. Start Lightnet:

    ```sh
    zk lightnet start
    ```

    The default settings start a single node that successfully serves the majority of testing requirements.

1. Verify the status of the local blockchain:

    ```sh
    zk lightnet status
    ```

1. Communicate with the Mina Accounts-Manager service to fetch account details.

    - Mina Accounts-Manager is deployed to http://localhost:8181/ 
    - Use HTTP endpoints to acquire, release, list, lock, and unlock accounts

1. Configure your zkApp for Lightnet blockchain. Use the endpoints provided by the `zk lightnet status` command.

    - Deploy name
    - Set the Mina GraphQL API URL to deploy to: http://localhost:8080/graphql
    - Set transaction fee to use when deploying (in MINA): 0.1

1. Deploy your zkApp to Lightnet:

    ```sh
    zk deploy
    ```

### 8. Test with a live network

To deploy the smart contract to the Testnet, run the `zk` commands from the directory that contains your smart contract. 

1. Configure your zkApp.

    ```sh
    zk config
    ```

    Follow the prompts to specify a deploy alias name (can be anything), URL to deploy to, fee (in MINA) to be used when sending your deploy transaction, and the fee payer account. 

    For the Devnet, use:
 
    - Deploy alias name: `devnet` 
  
    - Mina GraphQL API URL: `https://api.minascan.io/node/devnet/v1/graphql`
  
    - Transaction fee to use when deploying: `0.1`
  
    - Account to pay transaction fees: Create a new fee payer pair
    
    See [Add a deploy alias to config.json](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/how-to-deploy-a-zkapp#add-a-deploy-alias-to-configjson).

    For other Testnets, use the details provided.

1. Choose a fee payer alias. A fee payer account is a developer account that is funded and can always pay fees immediately. When you configure a zkApp, you can choose to use a stored account or create a new fee payer account.

    - When prompted to choose an account to pay transaction fees, select to use a different account:

        ```sh
        Use a different account (select to see options)
        ```

        If this is the first time you are running the `zk config` command, you see these options:

        ```text
        > Recover fee payer account from an existing base58 private key
        Create a new fee payer key pair
        ```

        The option to choose another account is shown only if you have a cached fee payer account.

    - Next, select **Create a new fee payer key pair**:  

        ```sh
        Create a new fee payer key pair
        NOTE: the private key will be stored in plain text on this computer.
        ```

    - When prompted, give an alias to your new fee payer key pair. 

1. Fund your fee payer account.

    Follow the prompts to request tMina. 

1. Deploy to the Testnet. 

    ```sh
    zk deploy
    ```

    Follow the prompts. 
    
    See [How to deploy a zkApp](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/how-to-deploy-a-zkapp).

1. Create a script to interact with a live network.

    See the example files:
    - https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/interact.ts
    - https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/main/src/examples/zkapps/hello-world/run-live.ts

1. Run your script.

    For example:

    ```sh
    node build/src/interact.js
    ```

1. Keep building and experimenting! After you add features to your contract, repeat [7. Test with a live network](#7-test-with-a-live-network) to test with a live network.
