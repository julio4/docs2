# How to Write a zkApp

A zkApp consists of a smart contract and a UI to interact with it. 

Write your smart contract using the [zkApp CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zkapp-cli/). 

First, install the zkApp CLI:

```sh
npm install -g zkapp-cli
```

See [zkApp CLI Installation](/zkapps/install-zkapp-cli). 

## Start a project

Now that you have the zkApp CLI installed, you can start with an example or create your own project.

Example projects do not create an accompanying UI. 

### Option A: Start with an example (recommended)

Examples are based on the standard project structure and provide additional files in the `/src` directory.

1. Create the example project:

    ```sh
    zk example
    ```

    The command prompts you to select an example project:

    ```text
    ? Choose an example …
  > sudoku
    tictactoe
    ```

    Select the `sudoku` example project. 

    The created project includes the example files (the smart contract) and the example test files in the project's `src` directory. 
    
1. View the files that were created:

    - Change to the `sudoku` directory.
    - Run the `ls` command
  
    Or open the directory in a code editor, such as VS Code.

1. This example zkApp includes the `sudoku.test.ts` test file. To run tests and see the tests pass: 

    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```
    
    To rerun tests automatically after you save changes to your code, you can run the tests in watch mode:

    ```sh
    npm run testw
    ```
 
1. Now that you have confirmed that tests run correctly, you can compile your TypeScript into JavaScript in the project `/build` directory. 

    To build the example:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    
    - The `npm run build` command builds the TypeScript files in `sudoku/src` that contain the code for the smart contract.
    - This build command compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript in the `sudoku/build` directory.  

1. Configure your zkApp:

    ```sh
    zk config
    ```

    The command prompts guide you to add a deploy alias to your project `config.json` file. 
    
1. Define a name for the deploy alias. 

    For this example, use:
  
    ```text
    devnet
    ``` 
      
    The deploy alias name does not have to match the network name.

1. Choose the target network kind:

    ```text
    Testnet
    ``` 
 
 1. Set the Mina GraphQL API URL to deploy to: 

    ```text
    https://api.minascan.io/node/devnet/v1/graphql
    ``` 

1. Set the transaction fee to use when deploying:

    ```text
    0.1
    ``` 
 
1. When prompted to choose an account to pay transaction fees, select:

    ```text
    Use a different account (select to see options)
    ```

    If this is the first time you are running the `zk config` command, you see these options:

    ```text
    > Recover fee payer account from an existing base58 private key
    Create a new fee payer key pair
    ```

    The option to choose another account is shown only if you have a cached fee payer account.

1. Select to create a new fee payer key pair:  

    ```sh
    Create a new fee payer key pair
    NOTE: the private key will be stored in plain text on this computer.
    ```

    A fee payer account is a developer account that can always pay fees immediately for local testing. Do not use an account that holds a substantial amount of MINA.

1. When prompted to create an alias for this account, give an alias to your new fee payer key pair:

    ```text
    testnet-fees
    ```

    Your key pairs and deploy alias are created.

1. Fund the fee payer account. After you fund the fee payer account, you can use to to pay fees across multiple zkApps.

    Follow the prompts to request tMINA to fund your fee payer account. For this example, your MINA address is populated on the Testnet Faucet. tMINA arrives at your address when the next block is produced (~3 minutes).

1. Deploy to Testnet:

    ```sh
    zk deploy
    ```

    Follow the prompts to select the `devnet` deploy alias and confirm that you want to send the transaction. 
    
    Your smart contract transaction is pending until the transaction is included in a block.

1. To view your transaction, click the block explorer link. 

    For example: 
    `https://minascan.io/devnet/tx/<txn-hash>?type=zk-tx`
    
    For details, see [How to Deploy a zkApp](how-to-deploy-a-zkapp).

### Option B: Start your own project

Instead of using a provided example, you can follow these steps to create your own project. 

1. Create your own project: 

    ```sh
    zk project <myproj>
    ```

    The created project includes the smart contract files in the project's `src/` directory. 

1. Select an accompanying UI framework, if any:

    ```text
    ? Create an accompanying UI project too? …
  > next
    svelte
    nuxt
    empty
    none
    ```
    
    For your selected UI framework, follow the prompts. See [How to Write a zkApp UI](/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp-ui).

    To see the files that were created, change to the project (whatever you called `<myproj>`) directory and run the `ls` command or open the directory in a code editor, such as VS Code.

1. When you use the zkApp CLI to create a project, the default `Add` smart contract is included along with the `Add.test.ts` test files. 

    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```
    
    To rerun tests automatically after you save changes to your code, you can run the tests in watch mode:

    ```sh
    npm run testw
    ```

1. To compile your TypeScript into JavaScript in the project `/build` directory, build the example:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    
  The `npm run build` command builds the TypeScript files in `yourproject/src` that contain the code for the smart contract. This build command compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript in the `yourproject/build` directory.  

1. Configure your zkApp:

    ```sh
    zk config
    ```

    The command prompts guide you to add a deploy alias to your project `config.json` file. 
    
1. To configure your deploy alias, follow the prompts:
 
    - Create a (deploy alias) name: _yourprojecttestnet_ 
    - Choose the target network: `Testnet`    
    - Set the Mina GraphQL API URL: `https://api.minascan.io/node/devnet/v1/graphql`  
    - Set transaction fee to use when deploying (in MINA): `0.1`  
    - Choose an account to pay transaction fees: 
      - `Create a new fee payer key pair`
    - Create an alias for this account: _yourdeployalias_

    Your key pair and deploy alias are created.

1. Fund your fee payer account. Follow the prompts to request tMina.

1. Deploy to Testnet: 

    ```sh
    zk deploy yourprojecttestnet
    ```

    Follow the prompts.

## Writing your smart contract

zkApps are written in TypeScript using o1js. o1js is a TypeScript library for writing smart contracts based on zero knowledge proofs for the Mina Protocol. o1js is automatically included when you create a project using the zkApp CLI.

To get started writing zkApps, begin with these o1js docs:

- [Basic concepts](./o1js/basic-concepts)
- [Interacting with Mina](./o1js/interact-with-mina)

A basic smart contract example is generated when you created a zk project. The high-level smart contract code workflow is:

1. Import `o1js`. 

    See the `import` statement in the [Add.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.ts#L1) file.

1. Extend the `SmartContract` class.

    See the exported `class` in the [Add.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/blob/main/templates/project-ts/src/Add.ts#L12) file. 

For guided steps to create your first zkApp, start with [Tutorial 1: Hello World](./tutorials/hello-world).

For comprehensive details about the o1js API, see the [o1js reference](o1js-reference).
