# Introduction to o1js

o1js is a TypeScript library for:

- Writing general-purpose zero knowledge (zk) programs
- Writing zk smart contracts for Mina

This is TypeScript code that you might write when using o1js:

```ts
import { Field, Poseidon } from 'o1js';

function knowsPreimage(preimage: Field) {
  let hash = Poseidon.hash([preimage]);
  hash.assertEquals(expectedHash);
}

const expectedHash =
  Field(0x1d444102d9e8da6d566467defcc446e8c1c3a3616d059facadbfd674afbc37ecn);
```

In a zkApp, this code can be used to prove that you know a secret value whose hash is publicly known without revealing the secret.
The code is plain TypeScript and is executed as normal TypeScript. You might call o1js an _embedded domain-specific language (DSL)_.

o1js provides data types and methods that are _provable_: You can prove their execution.

In the example code, `Poseidon.hash()` and `Field.assertEquals()` are examples of provable methods. Proofs are _zero knowledge_, because they can be verified without learning their inputs and execution trace. Selected parts of the proof can be made public, if it suits your application.

o1js is a general-purpose zk framework that gives you the tools to create zk proofs. It lets you write arbitrary zk programs leveraging a rich set of built-in provable operations, like basic arithmetic, hashing, signatures, boolean operations, comparisons, and more. Use the o1js framework to write zkApps on Mina, smart contracts that execute client-side and have private inputs.

All of the o1js framework is packaged as a single TypeScript library that can be used in major web browsers and Node.js. The best way to get started with o1js is [using the zkApp CLI](./how-to-write-a-zkapp). You can also install o1js from npm with `npm i o1js`.

Start your o1js journey by learning about [basic zk programming concepts](./o1js/basic-concepts).
